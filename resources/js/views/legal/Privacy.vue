                        <h5 class="mt-4 mb-1">Right to be informed - Request to know</h5>

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

                        <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
